How did viewing the difference between files help spot a bug?

viewing the differences meant I was able to read through all the changes and
find which one was causing the problems.

How does having access to the entire history of a file make you more efficient
as a programmer?

being able to see all the changes made to a file over its entire history
allows you to review changes more quickly and reset to previous versions.

What are the advantages of manually choosing when to create a commit vs
automatic saves?

manual saves allow you to save when you have made logical changes, while
automatic saves might leave you with saves that are unusable (won't compile)
or unhelpful (too small or large of changes)

Why do some vcs's allow for saving of multiple files while others don't?

because it is not always useful to save multiple files at once. If you are
writting some papers for some classes then you probably wouldn't want them to
save all at once. However, if you are editting related coding files
having all save at once would be helpful bc it eliminates redunant work.

How can you use 'git log' and 'git diff' to view the history of a file?

git log allows you to view the changes made to a file and git diff lets
you look at the difference between commits.

How does version control make you more confident to make changes that might
break something?

The knowlegde that in the worst case scenario you can just restore to
a working version of the program means that you will be more willing to make
mistakes.
